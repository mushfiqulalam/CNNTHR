CGCSF SOFTWARE RELEASE

========================================

Objective:

Generates the local visual masking thresholds (contrast detection thresholds) of an artifact when over-layed on an input natural image. Uses convolutional-neural-network. Furthermore, predicts the Quantization Parameter (QP) for HEVC distortion. The block size is [64 64]. The QP can be used to compress images.

========================================

Usage: 

Please run the demo.m in Matlab. Code is well commented.
